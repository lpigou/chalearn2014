    The STL-10 dataset

    Adam Coates, Honglak Lee, Andrew Y. Ng An Analysis of Single Layer
    Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning AISTATS, 2011

    http://www.stanford.edu/~acoates//stl10/

    When reporting results on this dataset, you are meant to use a somewhat
    unusal evaluation procedure.

    Use STL10(which_set='train') to load the training set. Then restrict the
    training set to one of the ten folds using the restrict function below. You
    must then train only on the data from that fold.

    For the test set, report the average test set performance over the ten
    trials obtained by training on each of the ten folds.

    The folds here do not define the splits you should use for cross
    validation. You are free to make your own split within each fold.
