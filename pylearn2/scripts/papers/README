The scripts in this directory are aimed at reproducing results from published
papers.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a different paper. Some of these papers were
originally written using pylearn2, while others were written using different
libraries and languages but the pylearn2 developers have made an attempt to
reproduce them here.

The papers partially reproduced so far are:

    AISTATS 2009.
