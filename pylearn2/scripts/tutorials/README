There are two kinds of tutorials in this directory.

Some tutorials are just subdirectories containing python scripts and yaml
files. To work through these tutorials, just cd into the subdirectory,
and open the README.

Some tutorials are ipython notebooks. These tutorials are single files with
extension .ipynb. Run these tutorials using ipython, e.g.

ipython notebook softmax_regression.ipnb

If you get an error message that looks like:
WARNING:root:500 GET /notebooks/b4261b8b-9d9a-477c-b370-b57f6143ea27?_=1363474284017 (127.0.0.1): Unreadable JSON notebook.

You are using too old of a version of ipython.
These notebooks require version 0.13 to work.
