This package has diverged from James Bergstra's original repo.

Some of it has been updated for Windows support, but this refers to parts
of pylearn2 outside of TheanoLinear so can't be pushed back to the original
repo.

matrixmul.py has been removed because it adds more ops than just matrix
multiplication into the graph. It was trying to implicitly do Space conversion.
pylearn2.linear has a replacement, but this can't really be pushed back to
the TheanoLinear repo because TheanoLinear doesn't have Spaces.

See unshared_conv/README for notes about modifications to that functionality.
